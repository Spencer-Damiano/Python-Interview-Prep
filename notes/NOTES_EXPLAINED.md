# Notes System - How and Why

## Purpose

These notes are **my personal cheat sheets** - written in my own words, organized how my brain works, for stuff I actually need to remember.

**Primary purpose:** Make my life easier when coding
**Secondary benefit:** Shows employers I learn from experience

## When to Add to Notes

Add something to notes when:
- You Google the same thing twice
- You forget Python syntax/methods
- You notice a pattern across 2-3 problems
- You make the same mistake multiple times
- Something finally "clicks" and you want to capture it

**Don't force it.** Notes grow organically based on real gaps you experience.
